# Solving Systems by Graphing - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what a system of equations represents
- Solve systems by graphing both equations
- Interpret the intersection point as the solution
- Identify systems with no solution or infinitely many solutions
- Apply systems to real-world problems

## Essential Definitions

### System of Equations
A **system of equations** is a set of two or more equations with the same variables.
- Example: {y = 2x + 1, y = -x + 4}
- Solution must satisfy ALL equations simultaneously

### Solution of a System
The **solution** is the ordered pair (x, y) that makes both equations true.
- Graphically: the intersection point of the lines
- Can be checked by substitution into both equations

## Graphical Method

### Steps to Solve by Graphing
1. Graph the first equation
2. Graph the second equation on the same coordinate plane
3. Find the intersection point
4. Check the solution in both original equations

### Reading the Solution
- Intersection point coordinates are the solution
- If lines don't intersect clearly, estimate or use algebra
- Always verify by substitution

## Types of Systems

### One Solution (Consistent and Independent)
- Lines intersect at exactly one point
- Different slopes
- Example: y = x + 1 and y = -x + 3 intersect at (1, 2)

### No Solution (Inconsistent)
- Lines are parallel (never intersect)
- Same slope, different y-intercepts
- Example: y = 2x + 1 and y = 2x + 5

### Infinitely Many Solutions (Consistent and Dependent)
- Lines are identical (same line)
- Same slope, same y-intercept
- Example: y = 3x + 2 and 2y = 6x + 4

## Identifying System Types

### Using Slope-Intercept Form
Convert both equations to y = mx + b form:

**One Solution**: m₁ ≠ m₂ (different slopes)
**No Solution**: m₁ = m₂ but b₁ ≠ b₂ (parallel lines)
**Infinite Solutions**: m₁ = m₂ and b₁ = b₂ (same line)

### Visual Recognition
- **Intersecting lines**: one solution
- **Parallel lines**: no solution
- **Overlapping lines**: infinitely many solutions

## Real-World Applications

### Business Problems
- Break-even analysis: when revenue equals cost
- Comparing pricing plans
- Supply and demand intersections

### Motion Problems
- When two objects meet
- Comparing different travel scenarios
- Distance-time relationships

### Mixture Problems
- Combining solutions of different concentrations
- Blending different types of items
- Finding optimal combinations

## Graphing Strategies

### Choosing Good Scales
- Use scales that show the intersection clearly
- Consider the range of x and y values
- Make sure both intercepts are visible when possible

### Accuracy Considerations
- Graph carefully with ruler and grid paper
- Use technology when high precision is needed
- Estimate fractional coordinates when necessary

### Checking Solutions
Always substitute the solution back into both original equations:
- If (a, b) is the solution, then both equations should be true when x = a and y = b

## Common Applications

### Example 1: Phone Plans
- Plan A: $20 + $0.10 per minute
- Plan B: $15 + $0.15 per minute
- When do they cost the same?

### Example 2: Rental Cars
- Company A: $30 + $0.20 per mile
- Company B: $25 + $0.25 per mile
- Find the break-even point

### Example 3: Fundraising
- Group 1 starts with $50, earns $3 per item
- Group 2 starts with $20, earns $5 per item
- When will they have equal amounts?

## Technology Tools

### Graphing Calculators
- Enter equations in Y= menu
- Use INTERSECT function to find exact intersection
- Verify with TABLE feature

### Online Graphing Tools
- Desmos, GeoGebra, etc.
- Allow for easy manipulation and exploration
- Good for checking hand-drawn graphs

## Limitations of Graphical Method

### When Graphing is Difficult
- Intersection point has non-integer coordinates
- Lines intersect outside the viewing window
- Very small or very large numbers involved

### When to Use Other Methods
- Need exact answers (not estimates)
- Dealing with fractions or decimals
- System has more than two variables

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Graphing equations incorrectly
- Misreading intersection coordinates
- Not checking the solution
- Confusing parallel lines with intersecting lines
- Forgetting to graph both equations
