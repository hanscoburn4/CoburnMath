# Graphing Linear Equations - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Graph linear equations using tables of values
- Identify x-intercepts and y-intercepts
- Understand the relationship between equations and their graphs
- Recognize linear vs. non-linear relationships
- Apply graphing to real-world situations

## Essential Definitions

### Linear Equation
A **linear equation** in two variables has the form Ax + By = C, where A and B are not both zero.
- Graph is always a straight line
- Variables have degree 1 (no exponents other than 1)
- Examples: y = 2x + 3, x + y = 5, 3x - 2y = 6

### Coordinate Plane
The **coordinate plane** consists of:
- x-axis (horizontal)
- y-axis (vertical)  
- Origin (0, 0) where axes intersect
- Four quadrants

### Ordered Pair
An **ordered pair** (x, y) represents a point on the coordinate plane.
- x-coordinate (abscissa): horizontal position
- y-coordinate (ordinate): vertical position
- Order matters: (3, 5) ≠ (5, 3)

## Intercepts

### x-intercept
The **x-intercept** is where the line crosses the x-axis.
- y-coordinate is always 0
- Written as (a, 0)
- To find: set y = 0 and solve for x

### y-intercept
The **y-intercept** is where the line crosses the y-axis.
- x-coordinate is always 0
- Written as (0, b)
- To find: set x = 0 and solve for y

**Example**: For 2x + 3y = 12
- x-intercept: Set y = 0 → 2x = 12 → x = 6 → (6, 0)
- y-intercept: Set x = 0 → 3y = 12 → y = 4 → (0, 4)

## Methods for Graphing

### Method 1: Table of Values
1. Choose several x-values
2. Calculate corresponding y-values
3. Plot the points
4. Connect with a straight line

**Example**: Graph y = x + 2
| x | y = x + 2 | Point |
|---|-----------|-------|
| -2| 0         | (-2,0)|
| -1| 1         | (-1,1)|
| 0 | 2         | (0,2) |
| 1 | 3         | (1,3) |

### Method 2: Intercepts
1. Find x-intercept (set y = 0)
2. Find y-intercept (set x = 0)
3. Plot both intercepts
4. Draw line through them

### Method 3: Slope-Intercept Form
For y = mx + b:
- Start at y-intercept (0, b)
- Use slope m to find next point
- Connect points with a line

## Standard Forms

### Slope-Intercept Form
**y = mx + b**
- m = slope
- b = y-intercept
- Most useful for graphing

### Standard Form
**Ax + By = C**
- A, B, C are integers
- A is usually positive
- Good for finding intercepts

### Point-Slope Form
**y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)**
- Used when you know slope and one point
- (x₁, y₁) is the known point

## Slope

### Definition
**Slope** measures the steepness and direction of a line.
- m = (rise)/(run) = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)

### Types of Slope
- **Positive slope**: line rises left to right
- **Negative slope**: line falls left to right  
- **Zero slope**: horizontal line
- **Undefined slope**: vertical line

## Linear vs. Non-Linear

### Linear Relationships
- Constant rate of change
- Graph is a straight line
- Equation has variables to the first power only

### Non-Linear Relationships
- Variable rate of change
- Graph is curved
- Equation may have variables with exponents ≠ 1

## Real-World Applications

### Distance-Time Graphs
- x-axis: time
- y-axis: distance
- Slope represents speed

### Cost Analysis
- Fixed costs: y-intercept
- Variable costs: slope
- Total cost = fixed cost + (variable rate × quantity)

### Temperature Conversion
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = (9/5)C + 32
- Linear relationship with slope 9/5

## Graphing Technology

### Using Graphing Calculators
- Enter equation in Y= menu
- Set appropriate window
- Use TRACE to find specific points
- Use TABLE for numerical values

### Checking Your Work
- Verify intercepts algebraically
- Check that points satisfy the equation
- Ensure the line passes through plotted points

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Plotting points incorrectly (x, y) vs (y, x)
- Not using a ruler for straight lines
- Forgetting to label axes and scale
- Confusing x and y intercepts
- Not checking that points satisfy the equation
