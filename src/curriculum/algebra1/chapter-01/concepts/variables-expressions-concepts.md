# Variables and Algebraic Expressions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Identify variables and constants in algebraic expressions
- Translate verbal phrases into algebraic expressions
- Evaluate algebraic expressions for given values
- Simplify algebraic expressions using properties of operations
- Apply algebraic thinking to real-world situations

## Essential Definitions

### Variable
A **variable** is a letter or symbol that represents an unknown or changing quantity.
- Common variables: x, y, n, t, a, b
- Can represent any number unless specified

### Constant
A **constant** is a number that has a fixed value.
- Examples: 5, -3, π, 0.75

### Algebraic Expression
An **algebraic expression** is a mathematical phrase that contains variables, constants, and operations.
- Examples: 3x + 5, 2y - 7, x² + 4x - 1

### Coefficient
A **coefficient** is the numerical factor of a term containing a variable.
- In 5x, the coefficient is 5
- In -3y², the coefficient is -3
- In x, the coefficient is 1 (understood)

## Translating Verbal Phrases

### Addition Phrases
- "sum of" → +
- "more than" → +
- "increased by" → +
- "plus" → +

**Example**: "5 more than a number x" → x + 5

### Subtraction Phrases
- "difference of" → -
- "less than" → - (order matters!)
- "decreased by" → -
- "minus" → -

**Example**: "a number y decreased by 8" → y - 8
**Note**: "8 less than y" → y - 8 (not 8 - y)

### Multiplication Phrases
- "product of" → ×
- "times" → ×
- "of" (with fractions/percents) → ×
- Variables written together → ×

**Example**: "the product of 6 and a number n" → 6n

### Division Phrases
- "quotient of" → ÷
- "divided by" → ÷
- Fraction bar → ÷

**Example**: "a number x divided by 4" → x/4

## Evaluating Expressions

### Steps for Evaluation
1. Substitute the given value for the variable
2. Follow order of operations (PEMDAS)
3. Simplify to get a numerical answer

**Example**: Evaluate 3x + 7 when x = 4
- Substitute: 3(4) + 7
- Multiply: 12 + 7
- Add: 19

## Simplifying Expressions

### Like Terms
**Like terms** have the same variable raised to the same power.
- 3x and 5x are like terms
- 2y² and -7y² are like terms
- 4x and 4y are NOT like terms

### Combining Like Terms
Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms.
**Example**: 4x + 3x - 2x = (4 + 3 - 2)x = 5x

### Distributive Property
a(b + c) = ab + ac
**Example**: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12

## Real-World Applications

### Perimeter Problems
- Rectangle: P = 2l + 2w
- Square: P = 4s
- Triangle: P = a + b + c

### Cost Problems
- Total cost = (price per item) × (number of items) + fixed costs
- Example: Phone bill = monthly fee + (cost per minute) × (minutes used)

### Age Problems
- Future age = current age + years from now
- Past age = current age - years ago

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Confusing "less than" order: "5 less than x" is x - 5, not 5 - x
- Forgetting to distribute: 2(x + 3) ≠ 2x + 3
- Not combining like terms completely
- Misidentifying like terms: 3x and 3x² are different
