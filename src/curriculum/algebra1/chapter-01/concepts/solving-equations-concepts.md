# Solving One-Step Equations - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of equation as a balance
- Use inverse operations to solve one-step equations
- Check solutions by substitution
- Solve equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Apply equation solving to real-world problems

## Essential Definitions

### Equation
An **equation** is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal.
- Contains an equals sign (=)
- Examples: x + 5 = 12, 3y = 21, n/4 = 7

### Solution
A **solution** is the value of the variable that makes the equation true.
- Also called the "root" of the equation
- Can be checked by substitution

### Inverse Operations
**Inverse operations** are operations that "undo" each other.
- Addition ↔ Subtraction
- Multiplication ↔ Division

## The Balance Scale Model

### Equation as Balance
Think of an equation as a balanced scale:
- Left side = Right side
- Whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other
- Goal: isolate the variable on one side

### Maintaining Balance
- Add the same amount to both sides
- Subtract the same amount from both sides
- Multiply both sides by the same number
- Divide both sides by the same non-zero number

## Types of One-Step Equations

### Addition Equations
**Form**: x + a = b
**Solution method**: Subtract a from both sides
**Example**: x + 7 = 12
- Subtract 7: x + 7 - 7 = 12 - 7
- Simplify: x = 5

### Subtraction Equations
**Form**: x - a = b
**Solution method**: Add a to both sides
**Example**: x - 3 = 8
- Add 3: x - 3 + 3 = 8 + 3
- Simplify: x = 11

### Multiplication Equations
**Form**: ax = b
**Solution method**: Divide both sides by a
**Example**: 4x = 20
- Divide by 4: 4x/4 = 20/4
- Simplify: x = 5

### Division Equations
**Form**: x/a = b
**Solution method**: Multiply both sides by a
**Example**: x/3 = 6
- Multiply by 3: (x/3) × 3 = 6 × 3
- Simplify: x = 18

## Checking Solutions

### Substitution Method
1. Take your solution
2. Substitute it back into the original equation
3. Verify that both sides are equal

**Example**: Check x = 5 in x + 7 = 12
- Substitute: 5 + 7 = 12
- Simplify: 12 = 12 ✓

## Special Cases

### Negative Coefficients
When dividing by a negative number, the solution will have the opposite sign.
**Example**: -3x = 15
- Divide by -3: x = -5

### Fractions
**Example**: x/(-2) = 4
- Multiply by -2: x = -8

### Decimals
**Example**: 0.5x = 3.5
- Divide by 0.5: x = 7

## Real-World Applications

### Distance Problems
- Distance = rate × time
- If rate and time are known, solve for distance

### Money Problems
- Total = (number of items) × (cost per item)
- Given total and cost per item, solve for number of items

### Geometry Problems
- Perimeter formulas: solve for unknown side lengths
- Area formulas: solve for unknown dimensions

## Problem-Solving Strategy

### Four-Step Process
1. **Read** the problem carefully
2. **Define** the variable (what does it represent?)
3. **Write** the equation
4. **Solve** and check the answer

### Example Application
"Sarah has $15. After buying a book, she has $8 left. How much did the book cost?"
1. Let x = cost of the book
2. Money left = Original money - Cost of book
3. 8 = 15 - x
4. Solve: x = 7, so the book cost $7

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to do the same operation to both sides
- Confusing which inverse operation to use
- Not checking the solution
- Misreading word problems
- Sign errors when working with negatives
