# Exponential Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Define and identify exponential functions
- Evaluate exponential expressions and solve basic exponential equations
- Understand the properties of exponential functions (domain, range, asymptotes)
- Model real-world situations using exponential functions
- Distinguish between exponential growth and decay

## Definition
An **exponential function** has the form f(x) = a·bˣ where:
- a ≠ 0 (initial value)
- b > 0 and b ≠ 1 (base)
- x is any real number (exponent)

## Properties of Exponential Functions

### Domain and Range
- **Domain**: All real numbers (-∞, ∞)
- **Range**: (0, ∞) if a > 0, or (-∞, 0) if a < 0

### Key Characteristics
- **y-intercept**: (0, a)
- **Horizontal asymptote**: y = 0
- **Passes through**: (0, a) and (1, ab)

### Behavior Based on Base
- **b > 1**: Exponential growth (increasing function)
- **0 < b < 1**: Exponential decay (decreasing function)

## Common Exponential Functions

### Natural Exponential Function
f(x) = eˣ where e ≈ 2.71828...
- Most important exponential function in calculus
- Appears frequently in natural phenomena

### Compound Interest Formula
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- P: principal amount
- r: annual interest rate
- n: number of times compounded per year
- t: time in years

### Continuous Compound Interest
A = Pe^(rt)

## Exponential Growth and Decay Models

### Growth Model
N(t) = N₀·e^(kt) where k > 0
- N₀: initial amount
- k: growth constant
- t: time

### Decay Model
N(t) = N₀·e^(-kt) where k > 0
- Half-life: time for quantity to reduce by half

## Solving Exponential Equations

### Same Base Method
If bˣ = bʸ, then x = y

**Example**: 2^(x+1) = 2³
Therefore: x + 1 = 3, so x = 2

### Taking Logarithms
If bˣ = c, then x = log_b(c)

**Example**: 3ˣ = 15
Therefore: x = log₃(15) = ln(15)/ln(3)

## Real-World Applications

### Population Growth
P(t) = P₀·e^(rt)
- Bacteria growth
- Human population models

### Radioactive Decay
N(t) = N₀·e^(-λt)
- Carbon-14 dating
- Medical isotopes

### Financial Applications
- Compound interest
- Investment growth
- Depreciation models

### Technology Applications
- Moore's Law
- Viral spread on social media
- Learning curves

## Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Identify the type**: Growth (b > 1) or decay (0 < b < 1)
2. **Find key points**: y-intercept and one other point
3. **Use properties**: Same base method when possible
4. **Apply logarithms**: When bases are different
5. **Check reasonableness**: Especially in real-world contexts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Confusing exponential and polynomial functions
- Forgetting that the base must be positive
- Misapplying properties when bases are different
- Not considering domain restrictions in applications
