# Teaching Strategies for Building Thinking Classrooms

## Core Principles from Peter Liljedahl's Research

### 1. Vertical Non-Permanent Surfaces (VNPS)
**Why it works:**
- Encourages risk-taking and experimentation
- Makes thinking visible to all students
- Promotes collaboration and discussion
- Reduces anxiety about making mistakes

**Implementation:**
- Use whiteboards, windows, or chart paper on walls
- Have students work standing up
- Encourage rough work and multiple attempts
- Take photos of work before erasing

### 2. Random Grouping
**Why it works:**
- Prevents ability-based hierarchies
- Encourages all students to contribute
- Builds classroom community
- Reduces social barriers to learning

**Implementation:**
- Use playing cards, popsicle sticks, or random number generators
- Change groups frequently (daily or every few days)
- Keep groups small (2-3 students optimal)
- Don't allow students to choose their own groups

### 3. Rich, Group-Worthy Tasks
**Characteristics of effective thinking tasks:**
- Multiple entry points and solution paths
- Encourage mathematical discourse
- Build on student intuition
- Connect to big mathematical ideas
- Promote productive struggle

**Task Selection Criteria:**
- Can students start working within 30 seconds?
- Will different groups approach it differently?
- Does it lead to mathematical discussion?
- Can it be extended or modified?

## Lesson Structure for Building Thinking Classrooms

### Phase 1: Launch (5-10 minutes)
**Teacher Actions:**
- Present the thinking task clearly and concisely
- Ensure all students understand what they're being asked to do
- Avoid giving hints or strategies
- Set expectations for group work

**Student Actions:**
- Listen to task presentation
- Ask clarifying questions about the task (not about how to solve it)
- Form random groups
- Begin working immediately

### Phase 2: Explore (15-25 minutes)
**Teacher Actions:**
- Circulate and observe student thinking
- Ask probing questions to extend thinking
- Avoid giving answers or direct instruction
- Take notes on student strategies and misconceptions

**Student Actions:**
- Work collaboratively on vertical surfaces
- Share ideas and build on each other's thinking
- Persist through challenges
- Document their reasoning and solutions

### Phase 3: Discuss (10-15 minutes)
**Teacher Actions:**
- Facilitate whole-class discussion of strategies
- Highlight different approaches and connections
- Ask students to explain and justify their reasoning
- Connect student work to learning objectives

**Student Actions:**
- Present their group's approach
- Listen to and question other groups' strategies
- Make connections between different methods
- Reflect on their learning

### Phase 4: Practice (Remaining time)
**Teacher Actions:**
- Provide differentiated practice problems
- Support individual student needs
- Monitor progress and provide feedback
- Prepare for next lesson based on observations

**Student Actions:**
- Work on practice problems at appropriate level
- Apply concepts from thinking task
- Seek help when needed
- Reflect on their understanding

## Questioning Strategies

### Questions to Promote Thinking
- "What do you notice?"
- "What patterns do you see?"
- "How did you figure that out?"
- "Can you convince me that's correct?"
- "What if we changed...?"
- "Does that always work?"

### Questions to Extend Thinking
- "What would happen if...?"
- "Can you find another way?"
- "How does this connect to what we learned before?"
- "What questions does this raise for you?"
- "Can you generalize this pattern?"

### Questions to Encourage Collaboration
- "What does your partner think about that?"
- "How can you build on that idea?"
- "Do you agree or disagree? Why?"
- "Can you help explain what they mean?"
- "What would you add to their explanation?"

## Managing the Thinking Classroom

### Creating a Safe Learning Environment
- Establish norms for respectful discourse
- Celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities
- Encourage risk-taking and experimentation
- Value process over product
- Promote growth mindset

### Addressing Common Challenges

**"I don't know where to start"**
- Encourage students to try something, anything
- Suggest they discuss what they notice
- Remind them that confusion is normal
- Point them back to the task without giving hints

**"We're stuck"**
- Ask what they've tried so far
- Encourage them to look at other groups' work
- Suggest they try a simpler version
- Ask probing questions to guide thinking

**"We finished early"**
- Ask them to find another way
- Challenge them to extend the problem
- Have them prepare to explain their solution
- Encourage them to help other groups

### Assessment in the Thinking Classroom

**Formative Assessment:**
- Observe student work on vertical surfaces
- Listen to mathematical conversations
- Note misconceptions and breakthroughs
- Use exit tickets or reflection questions

**Summative Assessment:**
- Include thinking tasks on tests
- Assess problem-solving processes, not just answers
- Use rubrics that value reasoning and communication
- Provide opportunities for revision and improvement

## Technology Integration

### Appropriate Uses of Technology
- Graphing calculators for exploration and verification
- Dynamic geometry software for investigations
- Online collaboration tools for sharing work
- Video recording of student explanations

### When to Avoid Technology
- During initial exploration of concepts
- When hand calculations build understanding
- When technology might replace thinking
- During collaborative problem-solving

## Professional Development and Reflection

### Self-Assessment Questions for Teachers
- Am I talking too much during lessons?
- Are students doing the mathematical thinking?
- Do I give students time to struggle productively?
- Am I asking questions that promote thinking?
- Are all students engaged in mathematical discourse?

### Building Your Practice
- Start with one element (e.g., vertical surfaces)
- Gradually incorporate more principles
- Reflect on what works and what doesn't
- Collaborate with colleagues
- Seek feedback from students
