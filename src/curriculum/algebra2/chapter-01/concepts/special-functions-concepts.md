# Special Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Graph and analyze piecewise functions
- Work with absolute value functions and their transformations
- Understand step functions and their applications
- Analyze greatest integer and other special functions
- Apply special functions to real-world modeling

## Types of Special Functions

### Piecewise Functions
Functions defined by different rules on different intervals:
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
\text{rule 1} & \text{if condition 1} \\
\text{rule 2} & \text{if condition 2} \\
\vdots & \vdots
\end{cases}$$

### Absolute Value Functions
- **Basic form**: f(x) = |x|
- **General form**: f(x) = a|x - h| + k
- **Properties**: Always non-negative, V-shaped graph

### Step Functions
Functions that are constant on intervals with jumps between intervals:
- **Greatest integer function**: f(x) = ⌊x⌋
- **Ceiling function**: f(x) = ⌈x⌉
- **Custom step functions**

## Key Characteristics

### Piecewise Functions
- **Domain**: Union of all pieces
- **Range**: Union of ranges of all pieces
- **Continuity**: Check at boundary points
- **Evaluation**: Use appropriate piece based on input

### Absolute Value Functions
- **Vertex**: Point where expression inside absolute value equals zero
- **Symmetry**: Reflection across vertical line through vertex
- **Transformations**: Same rules as other functions

### Step Functions
- **Discontinuities**: Jump discontinuities at integer values
- **Constant pieces**: Horizontal line segments
- **Applications**: Pricing, postal rates, tax brackets

## Graphing Strategies

### Piecewise Functions
1. Graph each piece on its domain
2. Use open/closed circles at boundaries
3. Check for continuity at boundary points
4. Combine all pieces

### Absolute Value Functions
1. Find the vertex
2. Determine if graph opens up or down
3. Plot additional points on both sides
4. Connect with V-shape

### Step Functions
1. Identify the intervals
2. Draw horizontal segments
3. Use appropriate endpoint notation
4. Show jumps clearly

## Real-World Applications
