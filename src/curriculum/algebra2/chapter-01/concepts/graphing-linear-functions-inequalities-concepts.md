# Graphing Linear Functions and Inequalities - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Graph linear functions using various methods
- Graph linear inequalities in two variables
- Solve systems of linear inequalities graphically
- Interpret solutions in real-world contexts
- Use linear programming concepts

## Linear Functions

### Standard Forms
- **Slope-intercept form**: y = mx + b
- **Point-slope form**: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
- **Standard form**: Ax + By = C

### Graphing Methods
1. **Using slope and y-intercept**
2. **Using two points**
3. **Using x and y intercepts**

## Linear Inequalities

### Inequality Symbols
- **≤ or ≥**: Use solid line (boundary included)
- **< or >**: Use dashed line (boundary not included)

### Graphing Process
1. Graph the boundary line
2. Choose test point (often origin if not on line)
3. Substitute into inequality
4. Shade appropriate region

### Systems of Inequalities
- **Feasible region**: Area where all inequalities are satisfied
- **Vertices**: Corner points of feasible region
- **Bounded vs. unbounded**: Whether region is enclosed

## Linear Programming

### Components
- **Objective function**: What to maximize or minimize
- **Constraints**: Limitations on variables
- **Feasible region**: All possible solutions
- **Optimal solution**: Best value of objective function

### Solution Process
1. Graph all constraints
2. Find feasible region
3. Identify vertices
4. Evaluate objective function at each vertex
5. Choose optimal solution
