# Functions and Continuity - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of function continuity
- Identify continuous and discontinuous functions
- Analyze function behavior at points of discontinuity
- Apply continuity concepts to real-world situations
- Use limit notation to describe continuity

## Essential Definitions

### Function Continuity
A function f(x) is **continuous** at a point x = a if:
1. f(a) is defined
2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a exists
3. The limit equals f(a)

### Types of Discontinuities
- **Removable discontinuity**: A "hole" in the graph that can be "filled"
- **Jump discontinuity**: The function "jumps" from one value to another
- **Infinite discontinuity**: The function approaches infinity at a point

## Key Concepts

### Continuous Functions
Common continuous functions include:
- Polynomial functions
- Exponential functions
- Logarithmic functions (on their domains)
- Trigonometric functions

### Analyzing Discontinuities
To determine if a function is continuous at x = a:
1. Check if f(a) exists
2. Find the left and right limits as x approaches a
3. Compare the limit with f(a)

### Real-World Applications
- Temperature changes over time
- Population growth models
- Economic functions
- Physical motion
