# Extrema and End Behavior - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Identify local and global extrema of functions
- Analyze end behavior of polynomial and rational functions
- Use extrema to solve optimization problems
- Describe function behavior using proper mathematical language
- Connect extrema and end behavior to real-world applications

## Essential Definitions

### Extrema
- **Local maximum**: Highest point in a neighborhood
- **Local minimum**: Lowest point in a neighborhood  
- **Global maximum**: Highest point on entire domain
- **Global minimum**: Lowest point on entire domain

### End Behavior
The behavior of a function as x approaches positive or negative infinity:
- As x → +∞, f(x) → ?
- As x → -∞, f(x) → ?

## Key Concepts

### Finding Extrema
- **Graphically**: Identify peaks and valleys
- **Algebraically**: Find where derivative equals zero (calculus)
- **By inspection**: Use function properties and transformations

### End Behavior Patterns
**Polynomial Functions:**
- Degree and leading coefficient determine end behavior
- Even degree: same behavior on both ends
- Odd degree: opposite behavior on both ends

**Rational Functions:**
- Compare degrees of numerator and denominator
- Horizontal asymptotes affect end behavior

### Real-World Applications
- Profit maximization
- Minimizing cost or time
- Optimizing design parameters
- Population dynamics
