# Sketching Graphs and Comparing Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Sketch graphs of functions using key features
- Compare functions represented in different ways
- Analyze function behavior from multiple representations
- Use technology appropriately to verify hand-drawn graphs
- Communicate function comparisons clearly

## Essential Skills for Graph Sketching

### Key Features to Identify
1. **Domain and Range**
2. **Intercepts** (x and y)
3. **Asymptotes** (vertical, horizontal, oblique)
4. **Extrema** (local and global)
5. **Symmetry** (even, odd, or other)
6. **End behavior**
7. **Intervals of increase/decrease**

### Step-by-Step Sketching Process
1. Identify the function type and basic shape
2. Find all intercepts
3. Determine asymptotes and discontinuities
4. Find extrema and critical points
5. Analyze end behavior
6. Plot key points and sketch

## Comparing Functions

### Different Representations
- **Algebraic**: Equations and expressions
- **Graphical**: Visual representations
- **Numerical**: Tables of values
- **Verbal**: Written descriptions

### Comparison Strategies
1. **Evaluate at specific points**
2. **Compare rates of change**
3. **Analyze long-term behavior**
4. **Find intersection points**
5. **Compare key features**

### Growth Rate Comparisons
- **Linear**: Constant rate of change
- **Quadratic**: Increasing rate of change
- **Exponential**: Rapidly increasing rate
- **Logarithmic**: Decreasing rate of change

## Technology Integration

### When to Use Technology
- Verify hand-drawn sketches
