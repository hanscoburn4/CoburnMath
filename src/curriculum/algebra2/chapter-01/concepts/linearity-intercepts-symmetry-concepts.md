# Linearity, Intercepts, and Symmetry - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Identify linear and non-linear functions
- Find and interpret x-intercepts and y-intercepts
- Recognize different types of symmetry in functions
- Use symmetry to analyze and graph functions
- Apply intercept and symmetry concepts to solve problems

## Essential Definitions

### Linear Functions
A **linear function** has the form f(x) = mx + b where:
- m is the slope (rate of change)
- b is the y-intercept
- Graph is a straight line

### Intercepts
- **x-intercept**: Point where graph crosses x-axis (y = 0)
- **y-intercept**: Point where graph crosses y-axis (x = 0)

### Types of Symmetry
- **Even function**: f(-x) = f(x) (symmetric about y-axis)
- **Odd function**: f(-x) = -f(x) (symmetric about origin)
- **Line symmetry**: Symmetric about a vertical line

## Key Concepts

### Finding Intercepts
- **x-intercept**: Solve f(x) = 0
- **y-intercept**: Evaluate f(0)

### Testing for Symmetry
1. **Even function test**: Replace x with -x and simplify
2. **Odd function test**: Replace x with -x and check if result equals -f(x)
3. **Line symmetry**: Check if f(a + h) = f(a - h) for some value a

### Applications
- Revenue and cost functions (linear models)
- Projectile motion (parabolic symmetry)
- Population models (various symmetries)
