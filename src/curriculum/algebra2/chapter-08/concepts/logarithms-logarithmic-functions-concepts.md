# Logarithms and Logarithmic Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Define logarithms as inverse functions of exponentials
- Convert between exponential and logarithmic forms
- Evaluate logarithmic expressions
- Graph logarithmic functions
- Apply logarithms to real-world problems

## Definition of Logarithm
**log_b(x) = y** means **b^y = x**

The logarithm answers the question: "To what power must we raise b to get x?"

## Exponential ↔ Logarithmic Forms
- **Exponential**: b^y = x
- **Logarithmic**: log_b(x) = y

**Examples:**
- 2³ = 8 ↔ log₂(8) = 3
- 10² = 100 ↔ log₁₀(100) = 2

## Common Logarithms
### Common Logarithm (Base 10)
- **log(x) = log₁₀(x)**
- Used in science and engineering

### Natural Logarithm (Base e)
- **ln(x) = log_e(x)**
- Used in calculus and natural phenomena

## Properties of Logarithms

### Basic Properties
- log_b(1) = 0 (since b⁰ = 1)
- log_b(b) = 1 (since b¹ = b)
- log_b(b^x) = x (inverse property)
- b^(log_b(x)) = x (inverse property)

### Domain and Range
- **Domain**: (0, ∞) - logarithms only defined for positive numbers
- **Range**: (-∞, ∞) - all real numbers

## Logarithmic Functions

### Basic Form: f(x) = log_b(x)
- **Domain**: (0, ∞)
- **Range**: (-∞, ∞)
- **Vertical asymptote**: x = 0
- **x-intercept**: (1, 0)
- **Passes through**: (b, 1)

### Behavior
- **If b > 1**: Increasing function
- **If 0 < b < 1**: Decreasing function

## Graphing Logarithmic Functions

### Key Points for log_b(x)
- (1, 0) - x-intercept
- (b, 1) - passes through
- (1/b, -1) - another key point

### Transformations
- **f(x) = log_b(x) + k**: Vertical shift k units
- **f(x) = log_b(x - h)**: Horizontal shift h units right
- **f(x) = a·log_b(x)**: Vertical stretch by factor a

## Solving Logarithmic Equations

### Method 1: Convert to Exponential
**Example**: log₃(x) = 4
Convert: x = 3⁴ = 81

### Method 2: Use Properties
**Example**: log(x) + log(3) = 2
Combine: log(3x) = 2
Convert: 3x = 10² = 100
Solve: x = 100/3

## Real-World Applications

### Scientific Applications

- Richter scale (earthquakes)
- Decibel scale (sound)

### Growth and Decay
