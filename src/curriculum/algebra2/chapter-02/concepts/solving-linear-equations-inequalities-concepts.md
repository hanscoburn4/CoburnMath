# Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Solve multi-step linear equations
- Solve linear inequalities and graph solutions
- Handle equations with variables on both sides
- Solve equations with fractions and decimals
- Apply linear equations to real-world problems

## Linear Equations

### Standard Form
ax + b = c, where a ≠ 0

### Solution Process
1. **Simplify** both sides (distribute, combine like terms)
2. **Collect** variable terms on one side
3. **Collect** constant terms on other side
4. **Isolate** the variable
5. **Check** the solution

### Special Cases
- **One solution**: Most equations
- **No solution**: Contradiction (e.g., 0 = 5)
- **Infinite solutions**: Identity (e.g., 0 = 0)

## Linear Inequalities

### Inequality Symbols
- < (less than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- > (greater than)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

### Solution Process
Same as equations, but:
- **Reverse inequality** when multiplying/dividing by negative number
- **Solution is an interval**, not a single value

### Graphing Solutions
- **Open circle**: < or > (value not included)
- **Closed circle**: ≤ or ≥ (value included)
- **Arrow**: Shows direction of solution set

## Working with Fractions

### Clear Fractions Method
1. Find LCD of all fractions
2. Multiply entire equation by LCD
3. Solve resulting equation
4. Check solution in original equation

### Example
$$\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x-1}{2} = 5$$
Multiply by 6: $2x + 3(x-1) = 30$

## Working with Decimals

### Clear Decimals Method
1. Multiply by appropriate power of 10
2. Solve resulting equation
3. Check solution

### Example
$0.3x + 0.7 = 1.6$
Multiply by 10: $3x + 7 = 16$

## Real-World Applications

### Common Problem Types
- **Cost problems**: Fixed cost + variable cost
- **Distance problems**: Rate × time = distance
- **Mixture problems**: Combining different concentrations
- **Age problems**: Relationships between ages
- **Geometry problems**: Perimeter, area formulas

### Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Define** the variable
2. **Write** the equation/inequality
3. **Solve** mathematically
4. **Check** reasonableness
5. **Answer** the question
