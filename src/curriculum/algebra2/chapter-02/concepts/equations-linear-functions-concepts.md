# Equations of Linear Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Write equations in slope-intercept form
- Write equations in point-slope form  
- Write equations in standard form
- Find equations given two points, point and slope, or other conditions
- Convert between different forms of linear equations

## Forms of Linear Equations

### Slope-Intercept Form
**y = mx + b**
- m = slope
- b = y-intercept
- Most useful for graphing and identifying slope/intercept

### Point-Slope Form
**y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)**
- (x₁, y₁) = known point
- m = slope
- Most useful when you know a point and slope

### Standard Form
**Ax + By = C**
- A, B, C are integers
- A is usually positive
- Most useful for finding intercepts quickly

## Finding Equations

### Given Slope and y-intercept
Use slope-intercept form directly: y = mx + b

### Given Point and Slope
1. Use point-slope form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
2. Simplify to desired form

### Given Two Points
1. Find slope: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
2. Use point-slope form with either point
3. Simplify to desired form

### Given Intercepts
- x-intercept (a, 0) and y-intercept (0, b)
- Use intercept form: $\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1$
- Or find slope and use point-slope form

## Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

### Parallel Lines
- Have the same slope
- Never intersect
- If line has slope m, parallel line also has slope m

### Perpendicular Lines
- Have slopes that are negative reciprocals
- Intersect at right angles
- If line has slope m, perpendicular line has slope -1/m

## Converting Between Forms

### Slope-Intercept to Standard Form
1. Move x-term to left side
2. Clear fractions if necessary
3. Make A positive

### Standard Form to Slope-Intercept
1. Solve for y
2. Identify slope and y-intercept

### Point-Slope to Other Forms
1. Distribute and simplify
2. Rearrange as needed

## Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Identify** what information is given
2. **Choose** the most appropriate form
3. **Substitute** known values
4. **Simplify** and convert if needed
5. **Check** by verifying points satisfy equation
