# Solving Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Solve absolute value equations using case analysis
- Solve absolute value inequalities and graph solutions
- Understand the geometric meaning of absolute value
- Apply absolute value concepts to real-world problems
- Identify extraneous solutions

## Absolute Value Definition
|x| = distance from x to 0 on the number line
- If x â‰¥ 0, then |x| = x
- If x < 0, then |x| = -x

## Absolute Value Equations

### Basic Form: |x| = a
- If a > 0: x = a or x = -a (two solutions)
- If a = 0: x = 0 (one solution)
- If a < 0: no solution (absolute value cannot be negative)

### General Form: |ax + b| = c
1. Isolate the absolute value expression
2. Set up two cases:
   - Case 1: ax + b = c
   - Case 2: ax + b = -c
3. Solve both equations
4. Check solutions in original equation

## Absolute Value Inequalities

### Type 1: |x| < a (a > 0)
- Solution: -a < x < a
- Graph: interval between -a and a

### Type 2: |x| > a (a > 0)
- Solution: x < -a or x > a
- Graph: two rays extending outward

### General Forms
- |ax + b| < c: Solve -c < ax + b < c
- |ax + b| > c: Solve ax + b < -c or ax + b > c

## Geometric Interpretation
|x - a| represents the distance from x to a on the number line
- |x - 3| = 5: points that are exactly 5 units from 3
- |x - 3| < 5: points within 5 units of 3
- |x - 3| > 5: points more than 5 units from 3

## Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Isolate** the absolute value expression
2. **Determine** if equation or inequality
3. **Set up cases** (equations) or **write compound statement** (inequalities)
4. **Solve** each case or part
5. **Check** solutions and **graph** if needed

## Real-World Applications
- Quality control and tolerances
- Temperature ranges
- Measurement precision
- Error analysis
- Distance problems

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting the negative case in equations
- Incorrectly handling compound inequalities
- Not checking for extraneous solutions
- Misinterpreting "greater than" vs "less than" inequalities
