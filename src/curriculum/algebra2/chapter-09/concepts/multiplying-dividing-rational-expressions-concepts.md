# Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Multiply rational expressions by factoring and canceling
- Divide rational expressions using reciprocal multiplication
- Simplify complex rational expressions
- Identify restrictions on variables
- Apply rational expressions to real-world problems

## Definition of Rational Expression
A **rational expression** is a fraction where both numerator and denominator are polynomials.

**General form**: $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials and Q(x) ≠ 0

## Multiplying Rational Expressions

### Rule for Multiplication
$$\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$$

### Steps for Multiplication
1. **Factor** all numerators and denominators completely
2. **Cancel** common factors
3. **Multiply** remaining factors
4. **State restrictions** (values that make denominators zero)

### Example
$$\frac{x^2-4}{x+1} \cdot \frac{x+1}{x-2} = \frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x+1} \cdot \frac{x+1}{x-2} = x+2$$
*Restrictions: x ≠ -1, 2*

## Dividing Rational Expressions

### Rule for Division
$$\frac{a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{d}{c}$$

### Steps for Division
1. **Change** division to multiplication by reciprocal
2. **Factor** all expressions
3. **Cancel** common factors
4. **Multiply** remaining factors
5. **State restrictions**

### Example
$$\frac{x^2-9}{x^2+3x} \div \frac{x-3}{x} = \frac{x^2-9}{x^2+3x} \cdot \frac{x}{x-3} = \frac{(x-3)(x+3)}{x(x+3)} \cdot \frac{x}{x-3} = 1$$
*Restrictions: x ≠ 0, -3, 3*

## Identifying Restrictions

### Why Restrictions Matter
- Denominators cannot equal zero
- Original expression must be defined
- Restrictions from both original expressions apply

### Finding Restrictions
1. **Set each denominator** equal to zero
2. **Solve** for variable values
3. **List all values** that make any denominator zero
4. **State restrictions** in final answer

## Simplifying Strategy

### Before Operations
1. **Factor completely** - look for:
   - Greatest common factors
   - Difference of squares: a² - b² = (a-b)(a+b)
   - Perfect square trinomials
   - General trinomials

### During Operations
2. **Cancel common factors** - only factors, not terms
3. **Be careful** with signs and negative factors

### After Operations
4. **Check** if further simplification possible
5. **Verify** all restrictions are included

## Common Factoring Patterns

### Difference of Squares
x² - a² = (x - a)(x + a)

### Perfect Square Trinomials
x² + 2ax + a² = (x + a)²
x² - 2ax + a² = (x - a)²

### General Trinomials
x² + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n) where mn = c and m + n = b

## Real-World Applications
- Rate problems (distance/time)
- Work problems (job completion rates)
- Concentration problems (mixing solutions)
- Economics (cost per unit)
- Physics (combined resistances)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Canceling terms instead of factors
- Forgetting to state restrictions
- Not factoring completely before canceling
- Losing track of negative signs
- Canceling factors that aren't common to numerator and denominator
