# Graphing Quadratic Functions - Key Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Graph quadratic functions using vertex form
- Identify vertex, axis of symmetry, and direction of opening
- Find x and y intercepts of quadratic functions
- Understand the effects of parameters on quadratic graphs
- Apply quadratic functions to real-world situations

## Standard Forms of Quadratic Functions

### Standard Form
**f(x) = ax² + bx + c**
- a ≠ 0 (determines direction and width)
- c = y-intercept
- Used for finding intercepts

### Vertex Form
**f(x) = a(x - h)² + k**
- (h, k) = vertex
- x = h is axis of symmetry
- Used for identifying transformations

### Factored Form
**f(x) = a(x - r₁)(x - r₂)**
- r₁, r₂ = x-intercepts (zeros)
- Used when zeros are known

## Key Features of Parabolas

### Vertex
- **Maximum point** if a < 0 (opens downward)
- **Minimum point** if a > 0 (opens upward)
- Formula: $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, then find f(x)

### Axis of Symmetry
- Vertical line through vertex: x = h
- Parabola is symmetric about this line

### Direction of Opening
- **a > 0**: Opens upward (U-shape)
- **a < 0**: Opens downward (∩-shape)

### Width
- **|a| > 1**: Narrower than parent function
- **0 < |a| < 1**: Wider than parent function

## Finding Intercepts

### y-intercept
- Set x = 0: f(0) = c
- Point: (0, c)

### x-intercepts (zeros)
- Set f(x) = 0 and solve
- Methods: factoring, quadratic formula, graphing
- May have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts

## Transformations

### From Parent Function f(x) = x²
- **f(x) = x² + k**: Vertical shift k units
- **f(x) = (x - h)²**: Horizontal shift h units
- **f(x) = ax²**: Vertical stretch/compression by |a|
- **f(x) = -x²**: Reflection across x-axis

## Completing the Square
Convert ax² + bx + c to vertex form:
1. Factor out 'a' from x-terms
2. Complete the square inside parentheses
3. Adjust constant term

**Example**: x² + 6x + 5 = (x + 3)² - 4

## Real-World Applications
- Projectile motion (balls, rockets)
- Profit/revenue optimization
- Area and volume problems
- Suspension bridge cables
- Satellite dish shapes

## Problem-Solving Strategy
1. **Identify** the form of the quadratic
2. **Find** key features (vertex, intercepts, axis)
3. **Plot** key points
4. **Sketch** the parabola
5. **Verify** with additional points if needed
